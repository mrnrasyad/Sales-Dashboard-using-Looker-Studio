## Dashboard Development (Looker Studio)

#### Data Integration and Import (Looker Studio)

- Import cleaned data from Google Sheets into Looker Studio.
- Validate and adjust data types (dates, numeric, currency).

#### Dashboard Design

Create a **double-page dashboard**:
  * **Products Dashboard** â†’ product performance, sales, and profitability.
  * **Customers Dashboard** â†’ customer distribution, segmentation, and behavior.

#### Charts and Visualizations:

  Products Dashboard
</p>

**Dashboard Summary:**
The sales dashboard shows total sales of $45.13K with a profit of $1.30K across 3,551 units (2019â€“2022). Liberica and Excelsa generated the highest profit, while Arabica and Light Roast led in sales volume. However, Liberica and Dark Roast variants underperformed in sales volueme. Sales peaked in 2021 but declined sharply in 2022, highlighting the need for renewed marketing or supply chain adjustments. Focus should remain on high-performing coffee types and profitable roast segments while revisiting pricing and strategy for weaker products.

**Products Dashboard Description:**

**Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity (Scorecards)**
  - Define new metric  `SUM(Unit Price Ã— Quantity)` for the **Total Sales** scorecards.
  - Using `SUM(Profit)`  for the **Total Profit** scorecards.
  - Using `SUM(Quantity)` for the **Total Quantity** scorecards.

 **Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart)**
  - Use `Order Date (Year)` as the **dimension** to track sales trends over time.
  - Use `SUM(Total Sales)` as the main **metric**, with `SUM(Profit)` as an optional metric.

 **Profitability by Coffee Type (Bar Chart)**
  - Use `Coffee Type` as the **dimension** to compare profitability across product categories.
  - Use `SUM(Profit)` as the **metric** for measuring total profit.

 **Total Sales vs Profit Segment (Bar Chart)**
  - Define a **Profit Segment** by grouping into bins: Low Profit (<25%), Medium Profit (25%â€“50%), and High Profit (>50%) as **dimension**.
  - Use `SUM(Profit)` as the **metric** to compare performance across segments.

 **Top Products by Quantity (Horizontal Bar Chart)**
  - Use `Coffee Type` or `Roast Type` as the **dimension** to rank products.
  - Use `SUM(Quantity)` as the **metric** to measure total sales volume.

 **Sales Detail (Tables)**
  - Use `Coffee Type` and `Roast Type` as the **dimension** to break down sales.
  - Use `SUM(Quantity)` and `SUM(Unit Price)` as the **metrics** to display detailed sales information.

 **Parameter**
  - Add a **Date Range** parameter to filter data by time.
  - Add a **Fixed List** parameter to filter by `Coffee Type` and `Roast Type`.

  Customers Dashboard
</p>

**Dashboard Summary:**
The customers dashboard records 913 total customers between 2019â€“2022, with the United States contributing the majority of profits ($1,013), while Ireland and the United Kingdom lag far behind. Customer growth peaked in 2021 (312 customers) but fell sharply in 2022 (166), indicating potential retention challenges. High-profit customers dominate (75.1%), yet loyalty card adoption shows no clear impact on sales performance. Future strategy should focus on retaining high-value customers, strengthening loyalty incentives, and expanding market share outside the U.S. to balance profitability.

**Customers Dashboard Description:**

**Top Customer and Total Customer (Scorecards)**
  - Using `Customer Name` as **dimension**, sorted by `Profit`, for the **Top Customer** scorecards .
  - Using `COUNT_DISTINC(Customer ID)` for the **Total Customer** scorecards.

 **Customer Growth Over Time (Line Chart)**
  - Use `Order Date (Year)` as the **dimension** to track customer growth over time.
  - Use `COUNT_DISTINC(Customer ID)` as the **metric** to measure the number of unique customers.

 **Customer Distribution by Country (Bar Chart)**
  - Use `Country` as the **dimension** to compare customer distribution across regions.
  - Use `SUM(Profit)` as the main metric, with `COUNT_DISTINC(Customer ID)` as an optional metric.

 **Customers by Loyalty Card (Bar Chart)**
  - Use `Loyalty Card` as the **dimension** to categorize customers.
  - Use `COUNT_DISTINC(Customer ID)` as the metric to **measure** the number of customers by loyalty card status.

 **Sales Detail (Tables)**
  - Use `Customer ID`, `Customer Name`, and  `Loyalty Card` as the **dimension** to break down sales.
  - Use `SUM(Sales)` as the **metrics** to display detailed sales information.

 **Parameter**
  - Add a **Date Range** parameter to filter data by time.
  - Add a **Fixed List** parameter to filter by `Country`, `Profit Segment`, and `Loyalty Card`.
