## Dashboard Development (Looker Studio)

#### Data Integration and Import (Looker Studio)

- Import cleaned data from Google Sheets into Looker Studio.
- Validate and adjust data types (dates, numeric, currency).

#### Dashboard Design

Create a **double-page dashboard**:
  * **Products Dashboard** â†’ product performance, sales, and profitability.
  * **Customers Dashboard** â†’ customer distribution, segmentation, and behavior.

#### Charts and Visualizations:

ðŸ“Š Page 1: **Products Dashboard**

**Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity (Scorecards)**
  - Define new metric  `SUM(Unit Price Ã— Quantity)` for the **Total Sales** scorecards.
  - Using `SUM(Profit)`  for the **Total Profit** scorecards.

 **Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart)**
  - Use `Order Date (Year)` as the **dimension** to track sales trends over time.
  - Use `SUM(Total Sales)` as the main **metric**, with `SUM(Profit)` as an optional metric.

 **Profitability by Coffee Type (Bar Chart)**
  - Use `Coffee Type` as the **dimension** to compare profitability across product categories.

 **Total Sales vs Profit Segment (Bar Chart)**
  - Define a **Profit Segment** by grouping into bins: Low Profit (<25%), Medium Profit (25%â€“50%), and High Profit (>50%) as **dimension**.
  - Use `SUM(Profit)` as the **metric** to compare performance across segments.

 **Top Products by Quantity (Horizontal Bar Chart)**

  - Use `SUM(Quantity)` as the **metric** to measure total sales volume.

 **Sales Detail (Tables)**
  - Use `Coffee Type` and `Roast Type` as the **dimension** to break down sales.
  - Use `SUM(Quantity)` and `SUM(Unit Price)` as the **metrics** to display detailed sales information.

 **Parameter**
  - Add a **Date Range** parameter to filter data by time.
  - Add a **Fixed List** parameter to filter by `Coffee Type` and `Roast Type`.

ðŸ‘¥ Page 2: **Customers Dashboard**

**Top Customer and Total Customer (Scorecards)**
  - Using `Customer Name` as **dimension**, sorted by `Profit`, for the **Top Customer** scorecards .
  - Using `COUNT_DISTINC(Customer ID)` for the **Total Customer** scorecards.

 **Customer Growth Over Time (Line Chart)**
  - Use `Order Date (Year)` as the **dimension** to track customer growth over time.
  - Use `COUNT_DISTINC(Customer ID)` as the **metric** to measure the number of unique customers.
